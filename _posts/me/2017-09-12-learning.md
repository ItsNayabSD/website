Try something new and repeat it several days but not repeat several times in a day. Neural processing takes time. Do learn like following.
~~~
Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
Yes Yes Yes No  Yes No  Yes

On the seventh day it becomes permanent.

## Sleep to make brain healthy
When you don't sleep, the toxic particles around brain cells makes the brain can't think very clearly. When you sleep, brain cells shrink and the toxic particles are washed away by the fluid. So sleep well, study well
