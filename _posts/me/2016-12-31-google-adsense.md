## Adsense application still under review
Don't change adsense code.

Place the generated adcode in in the head tag or on top of the body in the website URL, which submitted during adsense creation.

Place the code on the pages which receives regular visitors.
## Adsense application disapproved
Content should be original and site should be easy to navigare for a regular user.

Multiple adsense accounts.

Website is down or unavailable.
## Adsense policies
A website or page can have adcodes from two different pulishers (two different adsense accounts).

No action will be taken if some other sites are using your code.

Adcode can be added to two or more websites.

Don't place ads on page with partial or little content

Don't point to other sites that contain pirated content.

Don't display other website pages inside frame tag to display ads around that.

Don't display or point to adult content.

Don't display ads in expandable features such as menu.

One ad per screen (not per page). Mutiple ads can be placed but below the fold.
## Invalid traffic deductions
Deduction of money that actually generated through artificial click and impressions. Like, bots and accidental clicks.

Trusting third party partners who uses artificail ways to generate traffic. Like from social networking, forums or other means that solely created for generating traffic.

Accidental clicks on ads if there is no adequate space that says `ad`, people might assume that it was part of the content.
## Best practices for mobile ads
Use the ads with 300 x 250 or 336 x 280 ad sizes. Good choice is to place responsive ad units.

Place ad below title or in between content. 300 x 250 only below the fold.

## Ad positions
Right above the fold but not start of the page. Right above the fold ad stays more time on the screen while scrolling. Vertical ads visibles long time.


## Performance of the site
### Cache static content
Content like photos, videos.

## No of ads on a page
3 standard adsense for content ads and 3 link ads
## Adsense revenue depends on
### CPM (Cost Per thousand impressions)
Advertiser set the CPM. If CPM is $2, that means advertiser pays $2 if the ad appears 1000 times to the user. CPM is for advertiser only.
### RPM (Revenue per one thousand impressions)
Since ads can be from different advertisers, RPM is calculated by combining and averaging different CPMs. RPM is for publishers.
### CPC (Cost per click)
Advertiser set the CPC. Price the advertiser pays when an user clicks on the ad.
### CTR (Click through rate)
CTR = ((clicks on ads) /(ad impressions, views or queries)) * 100
### CPE (Cost per engagement)
Advertiser pays only when an user interacts with the ad. These ads are video or rich media ads.
### Active view CPM
Advertisers only pay when at least 50% of the ad is displayed on the screen for one thousand times.
### No. of ad impressions
Page views are different than ad impressions. If a page dislays three ads and user visited that page once then number of page views = 1 and number of ad impressions are 3. An ad unit can display more then one ad in it. In this case the number of impressions are also more than one.
### Clicks on ads:
## Ad Types
Text and display ads, in-feed ads and in-article ads.

These ads can be either fixed size or responsive.
### Recommended sizes
336 x 280 - Large rect. Within text content or end of the section of content.

300 x 250 - Medium rect. Within text content or end of the section of content. Great for mobile below fold placement.

728 x 90 - Leaderboard. Above the main content. And / or between articles.

160 x 600 - Skyscrapper. Left or right side of site.

320 x 50 - Mobile leadrboard. Fills the width of mobile site.

300 x 600 - Wide sidebar

970 x 90 - Large leaderboard

Custom ad size - 
## Blocking categories
As an example, one can block real estate, fashion websites ads on a site that has electronics content.
## Creating custom channels
Add channels based on different types of pages. Like ads displayed on home page can be grouped as separate channel and ads displayed on posts page can be grouped as different channel. Advertisers can look into these channels, bid their ads then only those kind of ads can be shown on the website. That means more revenue.
## A/B Test
Conduct experiments by comparing two different types of ads. Google splits time between these two ads on your website.
