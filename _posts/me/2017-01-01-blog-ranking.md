## Terminology
**Organic traffic** is the traffic getting from search engines when people search for something.

**Keywords**, also called queries or search terms are words or phrases user enters in search engine.

**Page rank**, a unit for measuring the importance of a web page. It will be calculated by counting the number and quality of links to that page.

**no follow link**, tell google to not follow the specific link because the link might not be trusted to the full. If the linked site is spammy, google might penalize the site which linked to it.

**Do follow links** are all the links other than no follow links. Search engines follow do follow links.

## How search engines work
When we make changes to our website, search engines sends spider programs to crawl our website. So do changes frequently.

Make sure all pages of a website all linked somehow. Spider crawls all pages then.

Submit URL manually for search engine because this way crawling will be faster.

## Improving SEO
### Developing keywords
#### Keywords placing
Prepare keywords for different pages of your website. And then add that keyword in the following manner.
 - Keyword in title
 - Keyword in URL
 - Keyword in meta tags
 - Keyword in the images alt text
 - Keywords in H1 tag and then H2 and so on.
 - Keywords as bold text one or two for a page.
 - Keywords in content.

#### Types of keywords
*Generic* keywords are very common. ex: Laptops. Stay away from generic keywords if your website is newer because big companies are already in race.

*Branded* keywords are brand specifice. ex: HP laptop. People are not interested in other brands.

*Long tail* keywords are long and specific. ex: Gaming laptops under $500. 70% of searches on search engines are long tail keywords. For new website build these keywords.
#### Keyword research
A perfect keyword for starters would be getting about 1000 searches per month, and have a low competition.

The more popular the keyword, the more expensive the CPC. The higher the CPC, the more profitable the keyword is. ex: Buy laptop online.

Keywords like "Learn how to use Linux" have very less CPC because advertisers don't generally run ad compaigns for this.
##### Tools for keyword research
 - [KWFinder](https://kwfinder.com/): Paid tool. Preferably keyword with *Keyword Difficulty* less than 40 should be better for startup.
 - [Keywords Everywhere](https://keywordseverywhere.com/): Free Chrome extension. Keyword competition should be < 0.4 for the beginner website.

### Optimizing website for SEO
Good to have keyword as part of domain name.

Title should be less than 65 characters.

Meta description length should be less than 260 characters.

Title for the sub pages should be related to the sub categories.
### Link Building
More important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.

Two factors:
 - Number
 - Quality

If you get lots of linking from new website, it won't have any affect on ranking.

Most of the websites like wikipedia, quora use nofollow attribution when any user posts external links. It won't increase page ranking though users might click on the link and visit page.

#### Types of links
 - *Natural In-content links*: Other websites links to your web page naturally. You don't ask them to do.
 - *Manual outreach links*: You ask them other website / blog owners to link your website.
 - *Self created links*: Links created by you on places like blog post comments, forum signatures etc. Search engine won't value it much.

Focus should be maximum on first two types of links. If you want to use blog comments or forums, give users a keyword to search that will direct traffic to your website. But don't post links.

#### Getting Links
*Small Goal*: 10 quality backlinks for the first 6-10 months

*Big Goad*: Raise it to 20-30 quality backlinks per month.


**Build great** content. Original and unique. So that people share it to create natural backlinks. Pasting by own on social sites won't generate quality backlinks. Instead if people starts sharing this will go multiple from friends to friends.

Find poeple interest in your topics. Cross exchange blogger links to link each other. But do not pay to other blogger.

**Social Networking Sites:**

Build Instagram, reddit, twitter, linkedin, Pinterest etc..

Put social networking share buttons on site.

**Participate in forums**

Quora

### Speed up the site
Check [pindom tools](https://tools.pingdom.com) to know which content is taking time. And optimize it.

Check also google page speed insights tool to get recommended optimizations.

*Chosing host*: If hosting server is goind down, search engines can list the site as unreliable. Should be a)Fast and SSD servers b)99% Uptime c)Reasonable price.

Digital Ocean

*CDN* Network of servers all over the world. Website is cached on all other servers all over the world. When a user visites website, nearest server will serve the user.

Cloudfare, I think we host entrire website. Need to try it out.
#### Optimizing Images
[Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/) - jpeg images unless images require transparent background (png).

[Tinyjpeg](https://tinyjpg.com/) for compress png or jpeg images
### Domain
Do not pay for WHOIS privacy. Instead use the fake address which looks real.

Search for expired domains if anything interests you. Use [https://www.expireddomains.net/](https://www.expireddomains.net/). Check this site in [archive](https://archive.org/web/) so that there is no objectable content previously on this website.

Check domain authority for a domain using domain authority tool to make sure whether it is new or expired site.

Referring domains 30+ would be good. Atleast 3 contexual links from reputable sites.

500 words or more per article. Atleast an article a month.

Convert all 404s to 301s. 404s are bad for SEO.

### Getting Traffic

Give / post keywords or social networking site link of the blog post when somebody asks for it. This will not show as direct accessing of website.

Check the footer for available social networking websites.

Keep active in certain niche groups, forums or QnA sites so that people visit the blog from the answers or blog profile.

#### Forums
For forums follow the links present in [master skills](/me/masterskills.html) page.
