Do not pay for WHOIS privacy. Instead use the fake address which looks real.

Search for expired domains if anything interests you. Use [https://www.expireddomains.net/](https://www.expireddomains.net/). Check this site in [archive](https://archive.org/web/) so that there is no objectable content previously on this website.

Check domain authority for a domain using domain authority tool to make sure whether it is new or expired site.

Referring domains 30+ would be good. Atleast 3 contexual links from reputable sites.
<!--after two or more paragraphs-->

  {% if jekyll.environment == 'production' and page.google_adsense %}
  {% include goog_inart_2par.html %}
  {% endif %}

Add post link to home page before posting it. Add links somewhere in the homepage to sites which domain autority is more than 50 (not the collaborative sites like wikipedia).

500 words or more per article. Atleast an article a month.

Convert all 404s to 301s. 404s are bad for SEO.
