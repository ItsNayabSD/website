A good way to get fiber is from plant foods -- vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds, beans, and legumes.

Eat more leafy vegetables, fresh fruits, beans, and whole-grain breads and cereals. Add fiber to your diet slowly since too much too fast can lead to gas and bloating. Drink lots of water to make it easier to go to the bathroom and avoid constipation or may be hemmorhoids or cancer.
