## Teminology
### Aperture
Aperture of a camera lense is the opening of the lense through which light comes through. Aperture generally represents as `f / f-number`.

Examples f/1.8, f/2.8 etc.

The lesser the f-number (or f-stop) value, the more the aperture of a lense. for example, f/2.8 has more aperture than f/16.
### Dynamic Range
Capturing details like doors in an architecture.
### Keystone distortion
In the pictures, buildings or persons seem like fallen backwards.
### Bulbus distortion
Photo seems like it got shrink from center to corners

### Sensor
The larger the sensor size, the better low light performance. Greater control over depth of field. Produce higher resolution images with less noise.
### Focal length
Focal length is measured in mm. Lower the value means the lens has less capable of zooming. Wide angle lenses comes with less focal length. Higher the value, the lens zoomed in (object seems nearer).
## Types of Cameras
Full frame sensor

Crop frame sensor
## Types of lenses
### Wide angle
Lense with focal length of less than 35 mm. Used to take photos of closer objects.

The lesser the f-stop value, the more the wide angle lense capabillity.

Aperture is more. Obsorbs good amount of light.

A good wide angle lense for full frame sensor is 16-35mm f/2.8 and crop frame sensor is 10-20mm f/2.8. Downfall of this lense is keystone distortion.
### FishEye lense
An extreme wide angle lense.

A 15mm f/2.8 lense for full framse sensor and 10 mm f/2.8 for crop framse sensor.

Downfall is bulbus distortion. Person can stand very near to object.
### Standard lense
Lense with focal lenght between 35 to 50 mm. These lenses captures images which seems real in nature to human eye.

### Telephoto lense
A 70-200mm f/2.8 lense. Minimizes distortion. We can stay far away from object. Bulky.
### Tilt shift lense.
A 17mm lense. Has the ability of a wide angle lense. And at the same it can tilt and shift to minimize the distortions.

## Other tools
Graduated neural density sensor.

Cable release or shutter grigger.

Cam ranger

Tripod
## Sensor size
Point and shoot cameras comes with smaller sensors. Wide angle lense cameras uses large sensors and gives better low light performance.
## Megapixels
The more the mega pixels of the sensor, generally the more the noise. So mega pixels is not always about clarity of the picture. Small sensor with more mega pixels product so much noise.
## Camera Settings
### Daylight photography
Manual mode

ISO: 100 or 200 for grabbing the light more.
Depth: f/11 is the excellent choice for depth of photography.
Exposure: Adjust shutter speed so that you can see exposure indicator exactly at 0. Exposure measure on a scale this,
```
-3	-2	-1	0	+1	+2	+3
```
### Night photography
Turn off image stabilizer when we are on tripod

ISO can be 100 or 200 on tripod.

Shutter speed higher. Preferably 1/3. Takes time to capture. But captures good details. Even laptop screen can be captured well.

Aperture can be from f/8 to f/11
Exposure: Adjust shutter speed so that you can see exposure indicator exactly at 0. Exposure measure on a scale this,
```
-3	-2	-1	0	+1	+2	+3
```
