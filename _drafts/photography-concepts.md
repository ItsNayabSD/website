## Teminology
### Dynamic Range
Capturing details like doors in an architecture.
### Keystone distortion
In the pictures, buildings or persons seem like fallen backwards.
### Bulbus distortion
Photo seems like it got shrink from center to corners

## Types of Cameras
Full frame sensor

Crop frame sensor
## Types of lenses
### Wide angle
A good wide angle lense for full frame sensor is 16-35mm f/2.8 and crop frame sensor is 10-20mm f/2.8. Downfall of this lense is keystone distortion.
### FishEye lense
A 15mm f/2.8 lense for full framse sensor and 10 mm f/2.8 for crop framse sensor. Wideangle photos. Downfall is bulbus distortion. Person can stand very near to object.
### Telephoto lense
A 70-200mm f/2.8 lense. Minimizes distortion. We can stay far away from object.
### Tilt shift lense.
A 17mm lense. Has the ability of a wide angle lense. And at the same it can tilt and shift to minimize the distortions.

## Other tools
Graduated neural density sensor.

Cable release or shutter grigger.

Cam ranger

Tripod
## Camera Settings
### Daylight photography
Manual mode

ISO: 100 or 200 for grabbing the light more.
Depth: f/11 is the excellent choice for depth of photography.
Exposure: Adjust shutter speed so that you can see exposure indicator exactly at 0. Exposure measure on a scale this,
```
-3	-2	-1	0	+1	+2	+3
```
### Night photography
Turn off image stabilizer when we are on tripod

ISO can be 100 or 200 on tripod.

Shutter speed higher. Preferably 1/3. Takes time to capture. But captures good details. Even laptop screen can be captured well.

Aperture can be from f/8 to f/11
Exposure: Adjust shutter speed so that you can see exposure indicator exactly at 0. Exposure measure on a scale this,
```
-3	-2	-1	0	+1	+2	+3
```
