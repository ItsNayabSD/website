functions

fn func_name() -> return type
{
}

struct Point
{
x:f54,
y:f64
}

fn origin -> Point
{
  Point(x: 0, y: 1) //We don't have ; here. Why??
}

pub fn stack_heap()
{
	let a = origin();
	let b = Box::new(origin()); // b is a pointer.
}

New .rs files can be includes using mod. ex: file name is point.rs. In the main.rs, include the line "mod point".

println!("{}", b.x);


Debugging Rust?? Any gdb like tool.
