Hard to track transactions.
Optimized for general purpose CPUs and anybody can mine from their home systems. So decentralization will increase.

For CPU with 1000 H/S, the amount of XMR being mined in a day is 0.0002.
For CPU with 10000 H/S, the amount of XMR mined per day is 0.002
For CPU with 60000 H/S, the amount of XMR mined per day is 0.012

For AMD 3990x -> Hash rate - 42000 H/S -> Per day 0.0084 XMR.
To get the minumim 0.07 XMR -> Nine days mining is required -> That is $25 -> approximately 1832.
