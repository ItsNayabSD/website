Need to get the page access token through my facebook developers page myapps.

From there go to facebook-login and enable.

App review -> Permissions and features -> Enable the advanced request access for the following.

    * pages_manage_metadata
    * pages_manage_posts
    * pages_show_list

To get page access token, go to url https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/ and generate page access token.

To get user-id of your account
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN"

To get page-id
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/{user-id}/accounts?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN"

Above output might have page-ids for all of your pages.

To post as page
curl -i -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v13.0/105408865399482/feed?message=Helloo%20World!&access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN"

Use the explorer tool to get the correct curl command to post to your page.
