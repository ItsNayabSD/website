Ethereum can be seen as a deeper layer technology infrastructure (the blockchain) while Ethereum World is imagined as more of an interface on top of it making the blockchain interactions easier and more social. 

If we would compare the Ethereum blockchain with the TCP/IP tech stack powering the Internet, you could say that Ethereum World could trigger for Ethereum in a way what the Web triggered for the Internet - accelerated adoption by lowering usability barriers.
