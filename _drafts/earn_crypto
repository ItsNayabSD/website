Unlocking stakes, defi unwinds (I stagger deposits so something always avail of needed), Nexo, Celsius, sold my car, mine crypto, risk mgmt always keep a cash float .... can be really inventive and minimalist.


Nexo :
Deposit BTC to earn interest. It needs 6 confirmations. So approximately 60 minutes before the assets are shown into user account.

Minds :
 * You can create Memberships so that your content can be shared only with your supporters.
 * You more you engage, the more you earn Minds tokens. Obviously you can't make living out of just engagement. But genuine engagement will help you definitely in other ways.
 * You can add liquidity in ETH/MINDS pool

BitClout :
 * You can sell products using pwbc.io in the BitClout
