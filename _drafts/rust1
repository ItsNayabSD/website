```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!\nI'm a Rustacean");
}
```
In the above example,

* Why there aren't any function returns?
* Does the function accespts any arguments?
* What about command line arguments?
* println! is macro. How macros are defined?


##Comments supported types -
### Single line of comments
//
/* */

### Block comments
/* line 1
line 2
line3
*/
Block comments can be nested. So very useful to comment out certain code. Is it possible in C too?

/*line 1
/* line 2 */
*/

## Formatted print
Do the Rust library functions can be read using man pages?
