## Why I want financial freedom?
I want to guide my children through out their education. Most of the schools and colleges in southern India don't provide the enough infrastructure for their career development. Worst part, they focus on teaching students how to get more marks in exam rather than how to improve their knowledge.

I want to do what I really love in life. I have a few career objectives and business plans in mind. But I need capital and time to execute them. I will be writing a separate blog post for them later.

I want to travel and enjoy the nature - forests, rivers, fields etc.

I don't want my family to feel any difference financially with or with out me around.

Financial freedom is only possible if you can beat the inflation after paying all of your taxes and still able to get decent returns on your investment.

## Where I am not investing
**Fixed deposits** - The interest rates given by banks generally less than inflation rate and can't beat inflation. Plus the returns are taxable. The effective returns fall way below 6% for the tax slab I belong to.

**PPF** - Generally less interest rate than EPF. Lockin period is too long, 15 years.

> What's the relation among stock market, inflation and bank FDs?

## Where I am investing
**EPF** - This is automatically deducted from the salary account. 12% of my basic salary. I am not going to withdraw this money until 2029. The investmet amount and the interest generated on this amount are not taxable. Generally the interate would be between 8% to 9.5%. Currently it is 8.65%.

Employer's share of 12% is split between EPS and EPF.

The following are assets I would like to invest in.
 * Fixed Interest
 * Mutual funds
 * Stock

## Where I want to invest
**VPF** - I would like to double (may be triple) my share of contribution towards my EPF next year. I need to make sure KYC in epfindia website is successful.

## The formulae required
```
Future value = Present value * (1 + r)‚Åø <br/>
	- r is the percentage. Useful to calculate FD interest over time.
	- n is the number of years if compounded yearly.
```
Above formula is not infaltion adjusted as the inflation varies each year. To find the current value of an asset adjusted for inflation is
```
Indexed cost of acquisition =
Actual purchase price * (CII during sale year / CII during purchase year)
	- CII is the cost inflation index, can be retrieved from
	  https://cleartax.in/s/cost-inflation-index
```
