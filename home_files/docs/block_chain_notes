Block chain technology requires Leaders.

Blockchain technology applications:
	- Peer to peer exchange of values : Money, security, intellectual
	property, data and identities.
	- Banks, businees, make a living of creations
	- Cryptocurrencies
	- Self-sovereign identity : No need to give our data to big conglomarates.
	- Smart contracts : Code executed in Blockchain software. Could be
	businees deals between consumers and producers.
	- Decentralized business models : One example; Middleman can be omitted.
	- Ledger of things : Transactions happens between devices; like a
	power hungry device can ask/negotiate additional power from
	neighbourhood solar panels. No human intervension required.
	- Could be used in preventing fraud in our voting machines.
	- Public and permissionless blockchains : Bitcoin or Ethereum.
	- Private and permissioned blockchain : Ripple or Hyperledger

What is Block chain?
	- It's a tool to accomplish above applications.
	- Internet is not designed to send or receive money without banks.
	Banks verify identities and charges fee to send or receive assets
	among people. Blockchain technology accomplishes the same without
	banks.
	- The technology called Internet of Value
	- It's also called Trust Protocol.
	- It's open source code that anybody can download, run it, use it for
	free and create applications based on it to manage transactions online.

Doing businees with Blockchain
	- It requires a lot of faith.
	- With peer to peer verification, there is no need of a third party.

Design principles underlying Blockchain
	- Network Integrity : Honesty, consideration (the value offered and
	accepted by people entering into contracts), accountability
	(responsibility) and transparancy are coded into blockchain.
	- Distributed Power :
	- Value as incentive
	- Security : Private key if for encryption and public key is for decyption.
	- Privacy : People should control and own their data.
	- Rights Preserved : Samrt contracts. Example music cretors.
	- Inclusion : Include more people in the economy. Stable payment system
	available to all.


Five forces of blockchain to protect artist rights
	- Enable smart contracts
	- Establish transparent person to person transactions
	- Establish a reputation system
	- Promote dynamic efficient pricing
	- Allow micromitering and micromonitizing : Only few seconds of song can
	be purchased for example.

Etherium
	- Instead of proof of work, it expects proof of stake.
Bitcoin network
	- A Bitcoin network node has four functionalities. Wallet, a full database, miner and network routing.
--------
Glossary
--------
Trust protocol
	- Transactions can be conducted directly between two or more parties.
	Verification done through mass collaboration rather than through banks.
	It's a trustworthy global platform for peer to peer transactions.
Smart contracts
	- Special purpose code executed in Block chain software to make a deal
	between peers
Blockchains
	- Distributed ledgers which operates on trust protocol are called
	Blockchains.
Hash rate
	- The Bitcoin network total processing power
Consensus
	- A general agreement.
Proof of work
	- The number of computations it took to find the Nonce.
Proof of stake
	-
Proof of activity
Proof of existence
	- A site that creates or registers cryptographic digests (hashes) of
	assets such as deeds, titles, receipts, or licenses on a blockchain.
	It doesn't hold the copy of files.
	- Combining proof or work and proof of stake.
Proof of capacity
	- Miners need to spend so much hard disk space for mining.
Proof of storage
	- Share their disk space in a distributed cloud.
Byzantine fault tolerance
Double spend problem
	- If the internet thinks money just like any other digital information
	( example photo), you will end up sending a single dollar/rupee to
	multiple friends. This is called 'double spend problem'.
	You can't spend the same money twice. Once you spent the money, that
	is gone. Blockchain verifies your previous transactions, calculates your
	assests and sends the money only if have assets in positive number. And
	this transaction is also recorded to your assests. Once you send the
	money through Block chain, that is recorded and is gone from your
	balance unlike your cat photo, which can be shared multiple times on
	social networks.
PKI - Public key infrastructure
	- A private and public keys to encrypt and decrypt the message
Simplified payment verification
	- No bank account, identity, citizenship, home addrss or stable
	local currency are required. Anybody can be able to connect to
	blockchain.
Zero knowledge proof
	- Method of authenticating a transaction without revealing much
	details about the transaction.
ZK-snarks
	- Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge
Ring signature
	- Made up of actual signer's signature combined with the non signers
	signatures in which all signatures are treated as equal and valid.
	This feature hides the origin of transaction. With key image, the
	network validates the transaction and sender.
Steward
	- A person responsible for something
Showstoppers
	- Are obstacles to the development and widespread adoption of
	blockchain technology.

-------
Bitcoin
-------
	As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not
cooperating toattack the network,  they'll  generate the  longest  chain
and  outpace attackers.

	Messages are broadcast on a best effortbasis, and nodes can leave and
rejoin the network at will, accepting the longestproof-of-work chain as proof
of what happened while they were gone.

	After the proof of work completed by miner, the block along with the
proof of work is broadcast to network. When the block is accepted by nodes in
the network, the winning miner receives the pre set number of Bitcoins. The
Bitcoin protocol mint the coins and send them to miner automatically. Then the
hash block is added to the chain.


--------------------
Blockchain challeges
--------------------
How it scales?
Can we scale without consuming too much power?
Can we agree on standards wihtout reverting to hierarchy?

---------------------
Blockchain Governance
---------------------
Stweardship is required at three levels
	- Platform level : Bitcoin peer to peer electronic cash system,
	and Ethereum. Standards, use cases and robust roll-out. For self-governance.
	- Application level : Dapps and ICOs. Standards and common applications.
	- The ecosystem level : Stake holders belong to same industry or protocol
	come to gether to change the industry. This level belong to advocasy
	groups.
Stakeholders
	- Industry pioneers
	- Venture capitalists
	- Banks and financial services
	- Developers
	- Academia
	- Leadership
	- Users
	- Governments and regulators
	- NGOs
Blockchain networks and operations can be regulated but not the software.
Blockchain next era required even more government involvement than did
the internet.
Blockchain needs to be self-governed using multi-stakeholder approach. This
approach is called Globale solution networks.
Global solutions framework
	- Use standard networks for coding
	- Networked institutions to welcome people with diversified idea to
	conclude what needs to be done.
	- Advocacy networks : To respect each other's interests and constraints.
	- Watchdog networks : To make sure no one does any harm to network.
	- Policy networks : To join policy debates and coordinate regulation.
	- Knowledge networks : Create and extend knowledge to get up to speed.
	- Delivery networks : Keep incentives for mass collaboration.

------------------------------------
Blockchain implementation challenges
------------------------------------
Overcoming showstoppers
	- The technology is not ready for prime time
		. The infrastructure is unevenly distributed
		. System lacks the transactional capacity for mass usage.
		. Inaccessibility to the average person : Often UI and wallets.
		. Liquidity : Out of 21 million bitcoins by 2140, fewer than
		this number will be of use because of lost wallets or unspend
		bitcoins hoping the increment in value.
		. High latency : For a transaction.
		. Behavioral changes : People need to change their behavior
		towards Cryptocurrency backups. They generally don't accustomed
		to backup their money.
		. Societal change : Is it really socially unhealthy to record
		every transaction on blockchain?
		. Lack of legal choices in a world of transaction finality:
		Blockchain works on smart contracts and parites can't go to
		court upon disagreement.
