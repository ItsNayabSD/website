Block chain technology requires Leaders.

Blockchain technology applications:
	- Peer to peer exchange of values : Money, security, intellectual
	property, data and identities.
	- Banks, businees, make a living of creations
	- Cryptocurrencies
	- Self-sovereign identity : No need to give our data to big conglomarates.
	- Smart contracts : Code executed in Blockchain software. Could be
	businees deals between consumers and producers.
	- Decentralized business models : One example; Middleman can be omitted.
	- Ledger of things : Transactions happens between devices; like a
	power hungry device can ask/negotiate additional power from
	neighbourhood solar panels. No human intervension required.
	- Could be used in preventing fraud in our voting machines.

What is Block chain?
	- It's a tool to accomplish above applications.
	- Internet is not designed to send or receive money without banks.
	Banks verify identities and charges fee to send or receive assets
	among people. Blockchain technology accomplishes the same without
	banks.
	- The technology called Internet of Value
	- It's also called Trust Protocol.
	- It's open source code that anybody can download, run it, use it for
	free and create applications based on it to manage transactions online.

Doing businees with Blockchain
	- It requires a lot of faith.
	- With peer to peer verification, there is no need of a third party.

Design principles underlying Blockchain
	- Network Integrity : Honesty, consideration (the value offered and
	- Distributed Power :
	accepted by people entering into contracts), accountability
	(responsibility) and transparancy are coded into blockchain.
	- Value as incentive

Etherium
	- Instead of proof of work, it expects proof of stake.
Bitcoin network
	- A Bitcoin network node has four functionalities. Wallet, a full database, miner and network routing.

Glossary
--------
Trust protocol
	- Transactions can be conducted directly between two or more parties.
	Verification done through mass collaboration rather than through banks.
	It's a trustworthy global platform for peer to peer transactions.
Smart contracts
	- Special purpose code executed in Block chain software to make a deal
	between peers
Blockchains
	- Distributed ledgers which operates on trust protocol are called
	Blockchains.
Hash rate
	- The Bitcoin network total processing power
Consensus
	- A general agreement.
Proof of work
	- The number of computations it took to find the Nonce.
Proof of stake
	-
Proof of activity
	- Combining proof or work and proof of stake.
Proof of capacity
	- Miners need to spend so much hard disk space for mining.
Proof of storage
	- Share their disk space in a distributed cloud.
Byzantine fault tolerance
Double spend problem
	- If the internet thinks money just like any other digital information
	( example photo), you will end up sending a single dollar/rupee to
	multiple friends. This is called 'double spend problem'.
	You can't spend the same money twice. Once you spent the money, that
	is gone. Blockchain verifies your previous transactions, calculates your
	assests and sends the money only if have assets in positive number. And
	this transaction is also recorded to your assests. Once you send the
	money through Block chain, that is recorded and is gone from your
	balance unlike your cat photo, which can be shared multiple times on
	social networks.

Bitcoin
-------
	As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not
cooperating toattack the network,  they'll  generate the  longest  chain
and  outpace attackers.

	Messages are broadcast on a best effortbasis, and nodes can leave and
rejoin the network at will, accepting the longestproof-of-work chain as proof
of what happened while they were gone.

	After the proof of work completed by miner, the block along with the
proof of work is broadcast to network. When the block is accepted by nodes in
the network, the winning miner receives the pre set number of Bitcoins. The
Bitcoin protocol mint the coins and send them to miner automatically. Then the
hash block is added to the chain.

1. How proof of stake helpful for a new node as he doesn't have any coins as stake?
