Block chain technology requires Leaders.

Blockchain technology applications:
	- Peer to peer exchange of values : Money, security, intellectual
	property, data and identities.
	- Banks, businees, make a living of creations
	- Cryptocurrencies
	- Self-sovereign identity : No need to give our data to big conglomarates.
	- Smart contracts : Code executed in Blockchain software. Could be
	businees deals between consumers and producers.
	- Decentralized business models : One example; Middleman can be omitted.
	- Ledger of things : Transactions happens between devices; like a
	power hungry device can ask/negotiate additional power from
	neighbourhood solar panels. No human intervension required.
	- Could be used in preventing fraud in our voting machines.

What is Block chain?
	- It's a tool to accomplish above applications.
	- Internet is not designed to send or receive money without banks.
	Banks verify identities and charges fee to send or receive assets
	among people. Blockchain technology accomplishes the same without
	banks.
	- The technology called Internet of Value
	- It's also called Trust Protocol.
	- It's open source code that anybody can download, run it, use it for
	free and create applications based on it to manage transactions online.

Doing businees with Blockchain
	- It requires a lot of faith.
	- With peer to peer verification, there is no need of a third party.
--------
Glossary
--------
Trust protocol
	- Transactions can be conducted directly between two or more parties.
	Verification done through mass collaboration rather than through banks.
	It's a trustworthy global platform for peer to peer transactions.
Smart contracts
	- Special purpose code executed in Block chain software to make a deal
	between peers
Blockchains
	- Distributed ledgers which operates on trust protocol are called
	Blockchains.

Bitcoin
-------
	As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not
cooperating toattack the network,  they'll  generate the  longest  chain
and  outpace attackers.

	Messages are broadcast on a best effortbasis, and nodes can leave and
rejoin the network at will, accepting the longestproof-of-work chain as proof
of what happened while they were gone.
