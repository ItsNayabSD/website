coordination costs- is the cost spent on making sure that all the employee of an organization works together. By using a token to incentives users,AKASHA is trying reduce transaction cost.
Contraction cost- is the cost spent on keeping the contract secret, when talking in terms of traditional. AKASHA is using smart contract and cryptography to ensure the integrity and security of the content published. The owned will decide who can view the item and who can not.
(Re)building Trust: Blockchain platforms offer the chance for people to transact with those that they don't know in a safe environment. The advantage they hold over traditional companies is that they aren't storing any of the user's data on a centralized server and that it will be moderated by the user, helping to build trust with them. 
Search Costs: These would be reduced from a user perspective as they know that they can search whatever they like on this platform without their data being taken or used for other peoples profit.
Coordinating Costs: These would be drastically reduced as the two significant co-ordinating systems are the market and hierarchy. AKASHA eliminates any hierarchy putting the user themselves in control. The overarching company for AKASHA is a non-profit.

If an enterprise were to implement the AKASHA network within their organization, what corporate boundaries might get re-defined or blurred? (2-4 sentences)

Transparency will increase
Cost of co-ordination will be reduced.
C suit will have to encourage employers to welcome new changes.
If AKASHA was implemented, the organization would have to look back at the nine questions to ask when setting corporate boundaries and the following may need to be re-defined or blurred:
Are there legal, regulatory, or political obstacles to change? This would be due to the fact that AKASHA would be a new platform operating on a new system for the firm so a deeper understanding of legal and regulatory restrictions for the platform would need to be thought up.
What are the new economics of corporate boundaries? As with a new platform being introduced and installed with a new method for communication and information sharing the economics of a firm could be shifted completely. 
The risk of partners. As this is a new technology offering there may be chances for partners to invade fundamental parts of your business. This could link to trying to redifne this alognside setting new legal and regulatory policies for the organization.


In Modules 3 and 4, Don discusses some of the social implications of blockchain technology (e.g. blockchain governance; the new social contract). What are some of the social issues that AKASHA is tackling and/or aspiring to tackle with their project? (2-4 sentences)

AKASHA is focusing on providing Freedom of speech and making the self-organised instead of a centralized one.[P19]



Unlike many blockchain-based initiatives, the AKASHA Project has not conducted an ICO (see p.15). Based on what you have learned throughout this course, what kind of business model do you think AKASHA could use to monetize their offering? Recall the business models that Don presented in Module 2 when preparing your response. (4-6 sentences)

Selling record and scientific paper, arts on the platform.
Tracking details or art world.
Sharing un-used disk space
p2p sharing.


As with all social media networks, they serve more than one purpose for their users. I believe that AKASHA could synthesize the ideas of a few different business models to monetize their offering. Creators of intellectual property and peer-to-peer production are obvious models that could be integrated due to the decentralization of information which will become more accessible for people, and the fact that people will very easily build a reputation on this platform. AKASHA could use this to promote prosumers. People can use to platform to create value in whichever ways that they want. 

Underlying all of this could be the universal base income that Don speaks about in module 4. AKASHA could give a small stake to each of the users based on AKASHA upon registration. If not a small stake, they could split a fraction of a percent between every user each time there is a transaction on their platform.
