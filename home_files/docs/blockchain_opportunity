		will be takenwhen the research is completed?
		* What has caused this problem or led to this
		opportunity?

		* Are there any initial ideas for the research method?
		* When are the findings required?

		* Secondary data - Information that is already available
		because it is published or has been compiled for some
		otherpurpose.
		* Primary data - Collected solely for the purpose of a
		survey. To get primary data you will need to question
		respondents directly or observe their behaviour in some way.

		behaveand think in the way that they do
		* Qualitative method
			. Rely heavily on the skills of the researcher or
			moderator to interact with the respondents and to
			dig deep into their motivations and experiences.
			. Used for exploring and understanding people’s
			needs, testing reactions to concepts such as new
			products andservices, advertising messages,
			approaches to buying etc, working out what the real
			issues or problems are.
