Industry transformations
	- Guidelines
		* Blockchain presents a big opportunity rooting out
		counterfeit products.
		* Businesses shouldn’t upheave their operations in
		order to be the first out the gate with some ill
		considered blockchain stunt.

Blockchain case commons : Blockchain Case Commons (BCC) is a
crowdsourced repository of blockchain applications and use-cases
spanning multiple industries and sectors.

Exploring your market
	- Categories of research
		* Market measurement
		* Customer satisfaction surveys
		* New product development
		* Usage and attitude surveys
	- Important aspects of code of practice of MRS
		* Respondents must be honestly and comprehensively
		told that the information is for research purposes
		and thattheir participation is entirely voluntary.
		* Information given by respondents is confidential
		and maynot be passed, in an identifiable form, to
		anyone outside theagency carrying out the research.
		* The results of research carried out for
		specificclients is confidential to that client and
		may not be disclosedto others or used to the benefit
		of other clients
		* Research agencies cannot be asked to lend their
		name to promotion claims which are untrue or not
		backed byresearch data
		* Agencies are required to safeguard all data to
		meet therequirements for confidentiality and ensure
		that records arekept for a reasonable time to allow
		queries arising from theresearch to be answered.
	- Data protection act
		* Definitions
		. Personal data - Any information which can be used to
		identify and individual person.
		. Processing of data - Gathering data and carrying any
		type of work using that data.
		. Data subject - Any person who shares his personal
		details with some entity.
		. Data controller - A person who processes the gathered
		individual data.
		. Notification - The process of registering data
		controllers with the UK/Govt.
		. Transparency - All data controllers must ensure the
		data subjects know why their data is getting collected.
		. Informed consent - Individuals must understand why
		the data is needed for researchers and then upon
		agreeing, they should give information.
	- Defining problem
		* A problem defined is problem half solved. Research
		needs to take place:
			What research exists already?
			What research is needed?
			Can the research readily be undertaken?
	- Questions to be asked before starting marketing project.
		* Why do this market research? What action
		will be takenwhen the research is completed?
		* What has caused this problem or led to this
		opportunity?
		* What is known about the area of research already?
		* Target groups for the research?
		* What specific information is needed from the research?
		(e.g.market size, trends, buying behaviour,
		customer needs, seg-mentation)
		* What is the proposed budget?
		* Are there any initial ideas for the research method?
		* When are the findings required?
	- Research design
		* Secondary data - Information that is already available
		because it is published or has been compiled for some
		otherpurpose.
		* Primary data - Collected solely for the purpose of a
		survey. To get primary data you will need to question
		respondents directly or observe their behaviour in some way.
	- Qualitative method
		* Used to find out poeple's attitudes and feelings
			toward a product or service.
		* Rely heavily on the skills of the researcher or
			moderator to interact with the respondents and to
			dig deep into their motivations and experiences.
		* Used for exploring and understanding people’s
			needs, testing reactions to concepts such as new
			products andservices, advertising messages,
			approaches to buying etc, working out what the real
			issues or problems are.
		* Sample size: Small. Not more than 50.
		* Unstructured or semi structured.
		* Interviews, discussions, video tapes, notes and
			content analysis.
		* Reliability and accuracy low.
		* Why qualitative?
			- To evaluate a market, product or consumer where
			no information exists 
			- To identify and explore concepts 
			- To take researchers rapidly up the learning curve
			when they know very little about a group of consumers
			- To identify behaviour patterns, beliefs, attitudes,
			opinions and motives 
			- To establish priorities amongst categories of behaviour,
			beliefs, opinions and attitudes 
			- To identify problems in depth and develop models for
			further research 
			- To put flesh on the bones of points arising from a pilot
			or major survey
			- To provide verbatim comments and anecdotes from
			participants – so that the research findings can be brought
			alive for the client 
			- To test how a questionnaire works by going through
			question by question asking about routing, sign posting,
			understanding and ambiguity 
			- Where direct questioning will not give us personal or
			hidden details about respondents.
		* The research groups
			- Focus groups : Small number of people that ivolves other
			people having similar interest for discussion regarding a
			topic.
			- Depth discussions : One researcher discusses in deep with
			each respondant one at a time.
			- Observation : Find out behavior of people by observing.
			Ex: Deploy cameras in shopping mall to see people's
			shopping patterns.
	- Quantitative method
		* For customer satisfaction measurement, customer segmentation
		and measuring customer attitudes.
		* Three methods
			- Direct measurement : Regularly measure the position of
			brands in the market by counting the sales or other metrices.
			- Self-compeltion surveys : Posting questionnaires to the
			target audience for self completion of surveys.
			- Intervewing
		* Quantitative research relates to quantity and is
			based on enough numbers of interviews to be able to
			obtain arobust measurement.
		* Structured and standardised.
		* Sample size: 200 or more.
		* Team: Research executive, data processing executive,
			fieldwork executive or fieldforce.
		* Process: Quetions, computer generated tables and
			statistical analysis.
		* Reliability and accuracy high.
	- Desk Research : Secondary data
		* Once desk research is completed, field work can be planned.
		* Used to find information about market sizing, trends,
		products, company profiling, pricing, distributions and
		promotions.
	- Sampling
		* Sample : Portion of large group.
		* Censys : Official research carried out by government.
		* Population : All the prople within a group.
		* Quota sample : Agreed number of people chosen within
		different groups of population.
		* Interlocking quota : Pople met with certain conditions
		like age range, gender etc.
		* sampling frame : List of people from which the Sample
		is selected.
		* sampling point : Place where interviewers carried out
		their survey.
