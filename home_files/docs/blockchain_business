Decentralizing the Enterprize
-----------------------------
Ethereum went live in July 2015.
Ethereum runds DApps such as smart contracts.
The difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains is, developers can
apps based on Ethereum blockchain.
ConsenSys employees have more dynamic roles
	- Authority is distributed not delegated.
	- Rules are transaparent to reduce office politics.
	- Enterprise is built to respond quickly to changing needs.

Transaction costs
	- Costs of search : Finding right people, information and resources
	outside the company.
	- Cost of coordination : Bring people together to work.
	- Contracting cost : Trade secrets, labour, policing and enforcing
	those principles.

A firm would expand until the cost of performing the transaction inside the
firm exceeded the cost of transaction performing outside the firm.

Internet has decreased the transaction costs.
	- WWW and browsers decrease the cost of search
	- Email decreased the cost of coordination.

Monopolies help innovation in short term, but may harm in the long term.


Opportunities for Blockchain
	- Search
		. Who sold which discovery to whom?
		. At what price?
		. Who owns this intellectual property?
		. etc.
		. Differences between internet search and blockchain search
			* Privacy
			* Multidimensional - Sequece of transactions
			* Value - More powerful performance
		. Search for the talent for example.
	- Contracting
		. Agreeing on terms and seal the deal.
		. Companies need to monitor and seeks remedies if counter parties
		doesn't deliver as promised.
	- Cordination
		. Bringing people together to work.
		. Two significant coordinating systems
			* Market : Price system for decentralized allocation of
			resources.
			* Hierarchy : Centralized authority allocates resources.
		. Agent costs not dropped : Costs of making sure that everybody
		inside the firm are acting in owner's interest.
	- Building trust

Determining corporate boundaries
Hacking your future : Boundary decisions

-----------------------------
Distributed Business Entities
-----------------------------
Simple smart contracts
	- Required very few to no people. A single exchange value.
Complex contracts
	- Involves more people and exchanges. Called Open network enterprises.
	Good at coordinating resources anywhere in the world.
Autonomous agents
	- Smart contracts with machine learning. Selling and buying services
	with it's own wallet.
Distributed autonomous enterprises
	- Autonomous agents collaborate to form different types of business
	models. This corporation or organization can have shares as initial
	coin offerings. Example is ConsenSys.
DAOs
	- Slock.it company is a disaster that to DAO can ever happen. Users sent
	ether to DAO smart contract to purchase DAO tokens. Token holders vote
	for the projects (DAOs) to fund the project on Ethereum network. The DAO
	is supposed to work as venture capital fund. If the token holders don't like
	the project they could call the split function and transfer their funds
	to child DAO. There was a flaw in the code. An attacker transfered almost
	1/6 th of Ether received to the child DAO because that flaw didn't update
	the balance on the network.
	- Effective blockchain governance is required on both on-chain and off-chain
	mechanisms.
New Business Models
	- Blockchain cooperatives : Blochchain based AriBNB, blockchain based Uber
	etc.
	- Creators of Intellectual property : Writers, singers etc.
	- Peer to peer production : Blockchain based Reddit for example.
	- The metering economy : Renting our excess capacity for all kinds of
	things on Internet of Things.
	- The platform builders : Let users use the platform technology to create value.
	- Animating the physical world : Making things come alive on blockchain.
	- Enterprise collaborators : Like Jive, Outlook etc.
DApps
	- Anybody can put certain piece of code on the blockchain to run securely.
Intellectual property
	- Blockchain essential patents are those that are foundational to a blockchain
	ecosystem
Payments, attribution and licensing
Distributed ownership

-------
C-Suite
-------
CEO sets the corporate culture through it's own behavior. If he embrace blockchain, the
company's employees and customers embrace it.
Effective CEOs broadcast their blockchain stories in the best form of communications
like staff meatings, press, blogs, conferences, analyst calls etc..
Senor people in company have to balance hype and the promise of technology.
	- Acknowledging market readiness and good financial results. Employees need to get into
	learning curve. Keep watching Blockchain pilots closely, participlate and do your own
	PoCs.
	- Effective marketing and communications. CEO needs to communicate outside the
	organization like press, blogs and he needs to talk to internal also. Employees
	believe what they read outside media and it can be inappropriate.
	- Avoid setting unrealistic expectations. CEOs need to learn from PoCs, memberships,
	consortia or in organizations like blockchain research institute.

COO - Cheif operating officer
	- Oversees supply chain revolution.
	- Every asset in blockchain has supply chain. COOs have the glimpse of these supply
	chain revolution. They can even help reinvent the global commerce system.
	- Industry applications of blockchain
		* Manufacturing : Foxconn is using blockchain as a trust platform among it's
		partners, suppliers and consumers.
		* Mining : Example diamond. Fraud, copyrights and provenance of a diamong history
		can be eliminated. All diamonds can be traced back to it's rightful owners. Buyers
		can be confident enough of their purchases.
		* Agriculture : Helps track the quality of soil and crops.
		* Retail : Walmart working on blockchain tech for food safety. Transport, efficiency
		and other positive results observed.
		* Border controls and customs : Can track money and goods
	- COOs grappling with the so many number of emerging technologies.

CLO - Cheif legal officer
	- Lawyers need to learn how to audit legal templates and make sure the smart
	contract software supports what it's party intended to do. Stick to well tested
	methods.
	- They need to stay on cases the links to blockchain. Those are smart contracts,
	ICO, patent filing across jurisdictions.
	- Block chain patent applications
		* To profit from their innovation.
		* To prevent others from using their invention.
		* To make invention available to controllers.
	- Blockchain patent application critiria.
		* It must be eligible.
		* Must be truly novel.
		* The design must be non-obvious. The more narrow and focus the clients
		can be.

CFO - Cheif financial officer
	- CFO markets the internal markets of organization with external markets.
	- Double or triple entry accounting
	- Cash flow, risk management, capital investing, corporate recruiting and
	strategy.

CMO - Cheif Marketing Officer
	- Product, Placement, Price and Promotion.
	- Design, pacakging, marketing, sales and delivery.
	- Need to learn blockchain protocols like pirates and Meta-X.
	- Easier to understand loyalty programs will emerge.
	- Organization will flatten from heirarchy to network.
	- Brands won't make claims, they need to provide proofs.

CTO and CIO - Cheif technology officer and Cheif information officer
	- Securing from cyberattacks, system failures.
	- Cultivate talent inhouse.
	- Keep an eye on quantum computing.


---------------------
Blockchain Regulation
---------------------
The second era of internet deals with money, securities, intellectual property,
identities, music, votes etc.
Regulators need to pass and to learn from the unintended consequences of their
over-reaction to crisis.

Global blockchain rights
	- Unrestricted access to all applicThere is no single regulatory models which works same ations
	- Balance between right to distribute and to access
	- Balance between right to privacy and to protect data.
	- Government should restrict the flow of info provided it's infrequent
	and the reasons are transparent.
	- Enforcement of contractual rights
There is no single regulatory models which works same for incumbant players
and start-ups.

Fundamental questions
	- In case of uncertainity, the regulators will normally
		* Observe
		* Make new laws
		* Make reports, laws or threats
	- Self regulated or not, government regulated or unregulated?
	Balanced combination of all three.
	- Does blockchain raise unique legal issues?
	- What exactly we are trying to regulate?
	Need separate regulation for blockchain ecosystem itself from distributed
	applications itself.

Regulatory principles
	- The sandboxes are regulatory environment to test the DApps or any
	blockchain based asset.

Blockchain governance
	- Regulations vs Governance
		* Regulations are laws to control behavior. Governance mostly
		related to stewardship, colloboration and incentifying work.
		* Value creation and control are not regulated.

Blockchain stack
	- The internet layer : ISPs can control transportation layer of internet,
	which in turn affects how blockchain works. They can regulate the internet
	for blockchain traffic.
	- The blockchain layer
	- The application layer

Multiple layers of blockchain governance
	- Governance structures
		* Governance by the Infrastructure : Rules directly encoded into
		blockchain. Called on-chain governance.
		* Governance of the infrastructure : All influences forces outside
		of techinical platform. Example: government. Called off-chain governance.
	- Each of these governance structures can be either:
		* Endogenous rules : Rules, social norms and other governance structure
		originated within community.
		* Exogenous rules : Influencing activity of community which originated
		outside of community.

Framework for blockchain governance
	- Both private and public sector can govern the blockchain.
	- Issues while creating a blockchain governance network.
		* Design
			. Should we start fresh or start on existing networks.
			. What is network mandata?
			. Will it have the power to apply or enforce policy?
			. Who is benifiting and who is accountable?
			. Will nation states yield authority to a global network?
		* Characteristics
			. Composition : Made of multi-stakeholders
			. Control : Made of state based organizations like UN or World bank.
	- Global solution networks.
		* Knowledge networks : Develops new thinking, research for solving problems.
			. Transparent, includes everybody.
			. Ex: MIT's digital currency intiative, Blockchain research
			institute, reddit etc.
		* Policy networks : Policy development and alternatives regardless
		of government support.
			. Ex: Coin center : Aims for innovation, consumer protection,
			privacy, licencing and anti-money laundering or KYC.
			The Chamber of digital commerce : Promoting acceptance and use
			of digital currencies and blockchain.
		* Standards network
			. Non state networks develops standards
			. Ex: MIT digital currency initiative. scalingbitcoin.org
		* Delivery networks
			. Ex: ICANN. Just delvers stuff. Here domain names.
		* Advocacy networks
			. Try to change policies of governments and organizations.
			. Ex: Electronic Frontier Foundation.
		* Watchdog networks
			. Monitor institutions to hold both accountable without
			integrity.
		* Platforms : Can foster innovation and global problem solving.
		* Networked institutions
			. World economic forum. True miulti-stakeholder institutions.
		* Diaporas : Dispersed from homeland but united by homeland culture
		and identity.
		* Governance networks : These combined the features of all above
		networks and bring them together.

Seven conditions for success
	- Environment supportive of incubators and entrepreneurship.
	- Community of corporate leadership
	- Proximity to educational institutions.
	- Strong investment climate.
	- Government support
	- Fair regulatory environment
	- Diverse community of talent

---------------------------------------
Morality
Fair politics
Physicall safety

Life
Liberty
Private property

Drivers for change
	- The fourth industrial revolution
	- Globalization
	- Demographic upheal
	- Climate change

Four pillars of society
	- The state (maybe govt.)
	- The private sector
	- Civil society
	- the individual

Blueprint for a new social contract
	- A new social contract for Economy, state and society
	- Old social contract that might not be true today
		* Need full employment for health and benefits.
		* Govt. is responsible for unemployment, persons
		with differently abled etc.. Solving this problem
		is wealth distribution.
		* Business and labor are pillars of prosperity.
		* Politicians act in public interest.
		* Evidence based debate, collaboration and compromise
		between political parties.
		* Mother will take care of herself.
	- Rethinking work
		* Fourth industrial revolution may decrease jobs by
		replacing with automation.
		* Guaranteed job backed by Universal basic income (
		pension for everybody.)
		* Portable safety net
	- Predistribution of wealth
		* Provide high speed broadband internet access
		* Persoanl ownership on personal information.
