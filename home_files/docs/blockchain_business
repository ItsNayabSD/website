Decentralizing the Enterprize
-----------------------------
Ethereum went live in July 2015.
Ethereum runds DApps such as smart contracts.
The difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains is, developers can
apps based on Ethereum blockchain.
ConsenSys employees have more dynamic roles
	- Authority is distributed not delegated.
	- Rules are transaparent to reduce office politics.
	- Enterprise is built to respond quickly to changing needs.

Transaction costs
	- Costs of search : Finding right people, information and resources
	outside the company.
	- Cost of coordination : Bring people together to work.
	- Contracting cost : Trade secrets, labour, policing and enforcing
	those principles.

A firm would expand until the cost of performing the transaction inside the
firm exceeded the cost of transaction performing outside the firm.

Internet has decreased the transaction costs.
	- WWW and browsers decrease the cost of search
	- Email decreased the cost of coordination.

Monopolies help innovation in short term, but may harm in the long term.


Opportunities for Blockchain
	- Search
		. Who sold which discovery to whom?
		. At what price?
		. Who owns this intellectual property?
		. etc.
		. Differences between internet search and blockchain search
			* Privacy
			* Multidimensional - Sequece of transactions
			* Value - More powerful performance
		. Search for the talent for example.
	- Contracting
		. Agreeing on terms and seal the deal.
		. Companies need to monitor and seeks remedies if counter parties
		doesn't deliver as promised.
	- Cordination
		. Bringing people together to work.
		. Two significant coordinating systems
			* Market : Price system for decentralized allocation of
			resources.
			* Hierarchy : Centralized authority allocates resources.
		. Agent costs not dropped : Costs of making sure that everybody
		inside the firm are acting in owner's interest.
	- Building trust

Determining corporate boundaries
Hacking your future : Boundary decisions

Distributed Business Entities
-----------------------------
Simple smart contracts
	- Required very few to no people. A single exchange value.
Complex contracts
	- Involves more people and exchanges. Called Open network enterprises.
	Good at coordinating resources anywhere in the world.
Autonomous agents
	- Smart contracts with machine learning. Selling and buying services
	with it's own wallet.
Distributed autonomous enterprises
	- Autonomous agents collaborate to form different types of business
	models. This corporation or organization can have shares as initial
	coin offerings. Example is ConsenSys.
DAOs
	- Slock.it company is a disaster that to DAO can ever happen. Users sent
	ether to DAO smart contract to purchase DAO tokens. Token holders vote
	for the projects (DAOs) to fund the project on Ethereum network. The DAO
	is supposed to work as venture capital fund. If the token holders don't like
	the project they could call the split function and transfer their funds
	to child DAO. There was a flaw in the code. An attacker transfered almost
	1/6 th of Ether received to the child DAO because that flaw didn't update
	the balance on the network.
	- Effective blockchain governance is required on both on-chain and off-chain
	mechanisms.
New Business Models
	- Blockchain cooperatives : Blochchain based AriBNB, blockchain based Uber
	etc.
	- Creators of Intellectual property : Writers, singers etc.
	- Peer to peer production : Blockchain based Reddit for example.
	- The metering economy : Renting our excess capacity for all kinds of
	things on Internet of Things.
	- The platform builders : Let users use the platform technology to create value.
	- Animating the physical world : Making things come alive on blockchain.
	- Enterprise collaborators : Like Jive, Outlook etc.
DApps
	- Anybody can put certain piece of code on the blockchain to run securely.
Intellectual property
	- Blockchain essential patents are those that are foundational to a blockchain
	ecosystem
Payments, attribution and licensing
Distributed ownership

Glossary
--------
Holacracy
	- No heirarchy or middle managers. A system of self organization in
	which individuals define and align work need to do together to get
	job done.
Blockcom
	- A company formed and functioning on Blockchain technologies.
