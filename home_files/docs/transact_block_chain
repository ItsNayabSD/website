Seven types of crpto assets, tokens, ICOs, smart contracts, four phases of
deal cycle, self-sovereign identity, six inefficiencies in current financial industry,
eight core functions to improve opportunities and triple-entry accounting

------------
Cryptoassets
------------
Crypto asset does
	- Regulation of new units
	- Verify transactions
	- Secure transactions without middleman
The seven types of cryptoassets:
Cryptocurrencies  
	- Zcash, Bitcoin, Monero, Metronome, Dash
Protocol tokens
	- Designed to pay for the computational resources required to execute
	smart contracts as part of a DApp
	- Ether. Ethereum is leading platform for ICOs and is the platform
	to run Dapps. Dapps are powered by smart contracts. Ethereum is the
	first automated investment bank.
	- When more apps on built on the network, demand for protocol
	token grows.
	- Neo, Aion and ICON are the networks similar to Ethereum.
	- Palkodat and Cosmos promise to combine all blockchains into seamless
	internet.
	- If Ethereum is the protocol, Augur is the application built on top
	on it and REP are the protocol tokens.
Utility tokens (app coins)
	- A programmable blockchain asset that provides consumers with access
	to services or resources within a DApp.
	- Token created to use on single application built on parent blockchain
Security tokens
	- Stocks and bonds moves to blockchain technology and dominates current
	cryptoassets. These can help restore public trust in cryptoassets.
	- Security token offerings are similar to ICOs. Security tokens needs
	to be backed up by comapny's profits or shares.
Natural asset or commodity tokens
	- To reward for reducing the usage of natural resources ex: carbon footprint
	- Commodity tokens backed by gold or oil or any natural asset.
	- Earth token cryptocurrency on Natural asset exchange blockchain.
	- Onegram token = one gram of gold.
Crypto-collectibles
	- Virtual : cryptokitties, battle arena
	- Real life : CLIO cryptocurrency to register real world works of art.
Crypto-fiat currencies and stable coins
	- Crypto-fiat currencies are backed by Government.
	- Stable coins are hybrid cryptocurrencies which almost pegging itself
	to underlying asset like fiat-currency or gold. Ex: Tether. It's pegged
	to US dollar.


----------------------
Initial Coin Offerings
----------------------
ICOs need not be cryptocurrencies. These can be digital assets like ownership
in a company, access to network, carbon credit or even art.
Augur : First ICO happened in the history.
ICO happens on blockchain offering tokens or crypto-securities (equity in company
or even bonds). Anyone in the world can become capital venture investor.

--------------
Smartcontracts
--------------
. Reduces transaction fees by eliminating intermediateries.
. Improve the security and privacy of parties involved.
. To enfore the terms of agreement
. Sets incentives in the form of rewards or penalties.
. In code, those are set of if-then statements.
Benefits:
	- Reducing mental transaction costs : Computer can do it
	more precisely.
	- Increased predictability
	- Broad security
Smartcontracts phases
	- Search : Matching drivers with riders in case of Uber.
	- Negotiation : Agreeing upon and committing to deal terms.
	Prices in case of Uber.
	- Performance : When the terms of contract is performed.
	- Post-performance : Incentives, ratings, credit card block in case of
	fraud performance etc..
Smart vs traditional contracts
	- Traditional contracts called wet code and smart contracts
	called dry code. Both needs to work together for better results.
	We can still rely on Performance verification code which is a
	failure of execution.

--------------------------
Smartcontract applications
--------------------------
Retail payments
	- Second layer on blockchain network like Lightening for Bitcoin, Sprite or
	Raiden for Ethereum solves the scaling problem. Long chain of offline
	transactions will finally reach settlement on chain without excess energy.
Worry minimized customers
	- Shortening forms that customer must fill, overcharges for services, preventing
	saving credit card information on server, implementing blockchain based payment
	systems.
Insurance
	- Paramatrice contract : Pays insurance based on measurable data. Not on
	some laws.
Logistics
	- Tracking. Could speed up inventory management, transportation, distribution,
	accounting, payment processes and more...
Algorithmic management

-------------------------
Smart contract strategies
-------------------------
. Audit the organization for any processes that can be measurable. If it is
measurable, put in on the blockchain.
. Consider using public blockchain wherever possible.
. Use smartcontracts in place of intermediaries.
. Consider hiring lawyers who knows computer science or software engineers
who know law.

------------------------
Identity and Identifiers
------------------------
Self-sovereign identity
	- We own our identity, we own our data.
Identity: Identifier + the data generated with that identifier. Examples
	of identifiers: Aadhar, PAN, gmail etc.
Problems with Identifiers:
	- There needs a overarching identifier like birth certificate.
	- Centralised govt. identifiers are vulnerable cancellation, forgery
	and theft.
	- Each identifiers data is stored in somebody else's database.
	- This identifier-centric system is very user un-friendly.
Identity on Blockchain
	Identity commons:
		. Free of corporate, government or third party.
		. Outlive users, so Can transfer our assets to our heirs.
		. Must enforce the right to be forgotten
		. Must be inclusive : Userfriendly.
Identity applications
	- Apps which gives identities : Civi, showCard, uPort, Shyft network
		. uPort has 20 byte hexadecimal string as identifier. This identifier
		serves as the address of proxy contract (code that lets us sign
		and verify a transaction, an action or a claim). It can be used to
		manage cryptocurrencies and token assets.
			* Proxy contracts can interact with smart contracts or offline data
			that gives access to read or write access if user willing to pay us.
			* Controller contract separates our cryptographic keys from proxy
			contracts. It contains a logic for identity recovery. If device is
			stolen, we can replace our private key without having to replace
			proxy identifier and all the assets associated with it.
		. Shyft reduces cost of compliance and increases data security.
	- Decentralized identity foundation
		. Consortium consists of Hyperledger, R3, Sovrin, accenture, Micorsoft, IBM
		etc.
		. Focuses on :
			* Identifiers and recovery
			* Storage and computation of data
			* Attestation and reputation
Managing health data on blockchain
	- Doctors can find right participants for each study. Participants can reap the value
	of their contributions.
	- AI + IoT + Blockchain could :
		. Improve quality of treatment
		. Improve the accuracy of diagnoses.
		. Improve the efficiency of clinical processes.
		. Improve the integrity of data
		. Help cut research medical costs
		. System less vulnerable to hackers
	- Phenomic data is data on physical and biochemical traits as they change because of
	our behavior, food, work etc.

-----------------------------
Rethinking financial services
-----------------------------
Six inefficiencies
	- Attestation : Eliminates intermediaries and establishes trust.
	- Cost
	- Speed : Trades, Money transfers
	- Risk management : Settlement risk, counterparty risk, systemic risk (Hersatt risk).
	- Value innvovation
	- Opensource
The golden eight
	- Authenticating identity and values
	- Moving value : No dollar spent twice
	- Storing value
	- Lending value
	- Exchanging value : Trading
	- Funding and investing
	- Insuring value and managing risk
	- Accounting and auditing
Problems with modern accounting
	- Tracking assets and verifying their ownerships
	- Greed
	- Human error
	- Fraud
	- Inability to support new businees models.
New frameworks for Accounting
	- The world wide ledger
		. Streamline compliance and reduce risk for bankers.
		. Regulators would have real time access.
		. Bakes integrity into financial system.
